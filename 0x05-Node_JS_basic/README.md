## 0x05. NodeJS Basics

##  Description
This project explores the basics of Node.js, including its core functionalities, creating HTTP servers, and using Express.js. The tasks range from running basic JavaScript with Node.js to setting up advanced HTTP routes and handling asynchronous file operations. The project is designed to give a foundational understanding of back-end development using Node.js and Express.js.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Run JavaScript using Node.js.
- Use Node.js modules.
- Read files synchronously and asynchronously using Node.js.
- Access command line arguments and environment variables using process.
- Set up a basic HTTP server with Node.js and Express.js.
- Create advanced routes with Express.js.
- Use ES6 with Node.js using Babel.
- Speed up development with Nodemon.

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend-javascript

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd 0x05-Node_JS_basic

3. Install the project dependencies:
npm install

## Provided Files
- database.csv: A sample CSV file used in tasks for reading student data.
- package.json: Contains the project dependencies and scripts.
- babel.config.js: Babel configuration file for ES6 transpiling.
- .eslintrc.js: ESLint configuration file for linting JavaScript code.

## Tasks Overview
0. Basic JavaScript Execution with Node.js
Create a function displayMessage that prints a string to STDOUT.

1. Using Process stdin
Create a program that interacts with the user via command line input and output.

2. Reading a File Synchronously
Write a function countStudents to read and process a CSV file synchronously.

3. Reading a File Asynchronously
Refactor the countStudents function to read the CSV file asynchronously using promises.

4. Creating a Basic HTTP Server with Node.js
Create a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello Holberton School!" on any endpoint.

5. Complex HTTP Server with Node.js
Extend the previous HTTP server to handle multiple routes and display student data.

6. Creating a Basic HTTP Server with Express
Install and use Express.js to create a similar HTTP server to the one created in Task 4.

7. Complex HTTP Server with Express
Extend the Express.js server to handle student data routes similar to Task 5.

8. Organizing a Complex Server
Structure a full Express.js server with controllers, routes, and utility functions, including asynchronous file reading.
