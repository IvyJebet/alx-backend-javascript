## 0x02. ES6 Classes
## Overview
This project focuses on learning and implementing ES6 classes in JavaScript. Classes in ES6 provide a more concise and clear way to create and manage objects and inheritance, making it easier to write and maintain complex code. You will learn how to define classes, add methods, use static methods, extend classes, and explore metaprogramming and symbols.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Define a class in JavaScript.
2. Add methods to a class.
3. Understand why and how to add static methods to a class.
4. Extend a class from another class.
5. Implement metaprogramming and utilize symbols in your classes.
